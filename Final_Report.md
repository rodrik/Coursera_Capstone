# 1. Background and problem description

Americans love pizza – and the numbers confirm it. This market is worth a whopping $45.7 billion in the U.S. and $144.6 billion worldwide. With more than 76,993 pizzerias to choose from, customers have more options than ever before. [1]

More than half of U.S. pizza restaurant sales are generated by pizza chains, with the rest accounted for by independent restaurants. The leading pizza chains in the U.S. include Pizza Hut, Domino’s Pizza, Papa John’s and Little Caesars. [2]

Anyone planning to open their own pizza shop will face a lot of competition. In order to be successful it's needed to research the local market and learn where the competitors are. Therefore,it is advantageous for enterpreneurs to understand what neighborhoods have stronger competition and what are most likely to welcome a new pizza restaurant.

# 2. Data
Data that might contribute to determine what is the best neighborhood to open a new pizza restaurant might include: number of existing competitors, customer reviews [3] and demographics. 

The approach used in the study will be to find the most dense areas of a city which contains the least number of existing competitors and also how well or bad customers rate these restaurants.

The outcome will be an ordered list of what neighborhoods provide the best opportunities for a new pizza restaurant.
The city of San Diego was chosen due to easily accessible population data. [4]
